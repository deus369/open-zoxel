Open Source & Cross-platform + Performance is on Mushrooms~

Open-Zoxel is under the GPL license as I want any derivatives to stay open, to protect the end users and keep information free.

Zoxel has a large scope as I have many ideas. It's game design is influenced from Minecraft, Warcraft and LitRPGs/Tabletops.

## How far along is it?

So far I am fleshing out basic systems while testing out Flecs useage. So far the performance has been promising!

## Dependencies

I am using these libraries due to their light weight and power -unlimited power-

[SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/index.php) Simple DirectMedia Layer (zlib)

[Flecs](https://github.com/SanderMertens/flecs) Fast and lightweight Entity Component System

## Why The Change?

Zoxel has been in development a long time (over a decade), over many different engines. It is time for it to set sail again to a custom one, using FLECS for performance!

This was not an easy decision. Gotta go fast! Flecs has offered me a way out of the Unity IPO mess, and it offers greater levels of freedom over my development.

There are 120k+ lines on the unity ecs codebase, so it will take some time for things to be ported.
