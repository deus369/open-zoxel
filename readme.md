## Prioritizing Balance and Well-Being in the New Year

I am happy with the progress that I have made so far on my voxel RPG development. However, I have decided to take a step back and prioritize reducing stress in 2023. This means that I will be working on the game a bit less and focusing on other commitments, such as art, music, and playing games. It's important for me to take care of myself and make sure that I am in a good place both mentally and physically. While I am passionate about game development, it's important for me to find a balance and make sure that I am taking care of myself as well.

## Zoxel: A Game of Many Iterations and a Bright Future Ahead

Zoxel is a voxel-based RPG that has been in development for over a decade. The game was first made in Java in 2009, and has since been remade using different game engines such as Unity and Unreal. The most recent iteration of the game added Unity's Entity Component System (ECS), which improved its performance and scalability.

Now, the game is being remade again, this time using a custom game engine that the developer has written themselves. This will allow the game to be tailored to the developer's specific needs and requirements, resulting in a more unique and innovative gameplay experience for players.

Players can expect a vast, open-world environment to explore, as well as procedurally generated quests and enemies. The game's charming voxel-based graphics and character customization options will also add to the experience.

Overall, Zoxel is a game that has been developed with passion and dedication over many years, and players can look forward to a unique and engaging gameplay experience.
