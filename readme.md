## Development Story

Zoxel is a voxel-based RPG that has been in development for over a decade. The game was first made in Java in 2009, and has since been remade using different game engines such as Unity and Unreal. The most recent iteration of the game added Unity's Entity Component System (ECS), which improved its performance and scalability.

Now, the game is being remade again, this time using a custom game engine that the developer has written themselves. This will allow the game to be tailored to the developer's specific needs and requirements, resulting in a more unique and innovative gameplay experience for players.

Players can expect a vast, open-world environment to explore, as well as procedurally generated quests and enemies. The game's charming voxel-based graphics and character customization options will also add to the experience.

Overall, Zoxel is a game that has been developed with passion and dedication over many years, and players can look forward to a unique and engaging gameplay experience.

## 31.12.2022 Latest Update

I will have to delay the Steam release~ originally I planned a 2022 December release! I will finish porting at my own pace and create the Zoxel I can be proud of :D For now I need to spend some more time on my art and my portfolio. 

Overall I am happy where the porting in C Flecs SDL has gotten me to and where Zoxel Unity is at. Unfortunately Unity took longer with their ecs package and there were many #unity bugs while testing. Their priorities also changed over time, as did mine.

I will see how 2023 goes as I work on it a bit less. The last few years have been intense and I need to prioritize reducing stress more over my goals. That involves making myself work less, or doing things I enjoy more like art, making music or playing games.
