## What is Zoxel?

- A unique voxel-based visual style that sets the game apart from other RPGs

- Procedurally generated planets to explore, offering endless variety and replayability

- A rich and engaging story with quests, dialogue, and characters that players can connect with

- A robust skill and stat system that allows players to customize their character and playstyle

- Building and modding support, allowing players to create their own structures and custom content

- Explore a fantastical voxel world inspired by Minecraft, Warcraft, and LitRPG novels

As the developer of this game, I am incredibly proud of what I have created. This game is a voxel-based RPG that uses data-oriented design to procedurally generate everything, from the game's environments and characters to its quests and items. This means that no two playthroughs are the same, and players can experience a unique and unpredictable world each time they play.

One of the key features of this game is its voxel-based graphics, which give it a charming, retro aesthetic. The player can customize their character, choosing from a variety of voxel-based avatars and equipping them with procedurally generated weapons and armor.

The game is set in a vast, open-world environment that is generated on-the-fly as the player explores. The game's quests are also procedurally generated, offering a unique and challenging experience for each player.

As a solo developer, I have poured my heart and soul into creating this game, and I am thrilled to finally be able to share it with the world. I hope players will enjoy the endless replayability, unique gameplay, and charming aesthetic of this game as much as I do.

## Development Story

Zoxel is a voxel-based RPG that has been in development for over a decade. The game was first made in Java in 2009, and has since been remade using different game engines such as Unity and Unreal. The most recent iteration of the game added Unity's Entity Component System (ECS), which improved its performance and scalability.

Now, the game is being remade again, this time using a custom game engine that the developer has written themselves. This will allow the game to be tailored to the developer's specific needs and requirements, resulting in a more unique and innovative gameplay experience for players.

Players can expect a vast, open-world environment to explore, as well as procedurally generated quests and enemies. The game's charming voxel-based graphics and character customization options will also add to the experience.

Overall, Zoxel is a game that has been developed with passion and dedication over many years, and players can look forward to a unique and engaging gameplay experience.

## 31.12.2022 Latest Update

I will have to delay the Steam release~ originally I planned a 2022 December release! I will finish porting at my own pace and create the Zoxel I can be proud of :D For now I need to spend some more time on my art and my portfolio. 

Overall I am happy where the porting in C Flecs SDL has gotten me to and where Zoxel Unity is at. Unfortunately Unity took longer with their ecs package and there were many #unity bugs while testing. Their priorities also changed over time, as did mine.

I will see how 2023 goes as I work on it a bit less. The last few years have been intense and I need to prioritize reducing stress more over my goals. That involves making myself work less, or doing things I enjoy more like art, making music or playing games.
