## What is Zoxel

Is Open src & Cross-platform + Performance is on Mushrooms~

Is under the GPL license! I want any derivatives to stay open, to protect the end users and keep information free.

Has a large scope as I have many ideas. Game design is influenced from Minecraft, Warcraft and LitRPGs/Tabletops.

Check out my latest short dev log on YouTube!

## How To Build

After you download the repo, you can use Make commands to build it! [How To Build Guide](documents/howtos/howto-build.md)

### Dependencies

I am using these libraries due to their light weight and power -unlimited power-

[Flecs](https://github.com/SanderMertens/flecs) Fast and lightweight Entity Component System

[SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/index.php) Simple DirectMedia Layer (zlib)

[OpenGL](https://www.khronos.org/opengles/) OpenGL 3 ES

I may switch to Glut in the future to reduce build size even more, instead of SDL. I may also try out Vulkan.

## Why The Change?

Zoxel has been in development a long time. For over a decade, I first made it in Java in 2009. I have remade it over many different engines, unreal, unity, unity ecs. The latest iteration was made from 2017 where I added Unitys ECS. It is time for it to set sail again to a custom one, using FLECS for performance!

### Gotta go fast!

This was not an easy decision. Flecs has offered me a way out of the Unity IPO mess, and it offers greater levels of freedom over my development. There are 120k+ lines on the unity ecs codebase, so it will take some time for things to be ported.
