### A Description

As the developer of this game, I am incredibly proud of what I have created. This game is a voxel-based RPG that uses data-oriented design to procedurally generate everything, from the game's environments and characters to its quests and items. This means that no two playthroughs are the same, and players can experience a unique and unpredictable world each time they play.

One of the key features of this game is its voxel-based graphics, which give it a charming, retro aesthetic. The player can customize their character, choosing from a variety of voxel-based avatars and equipping them with procedurally generated weapons and armor.

The game is set in a vast, open-world environment that is generated on-the-fly as the player explores. The game's quests are also procedurally generated, offering a unique and challenging experience for each player.

As a solo developer, I have poured my heart and soul into creating this game, and I am thrilled to finally be able to share it with the world. I hope players will enjoy the endless replayability, unique gameplay, and charming aesthetic of this game as much as I do.

### A Poem

    In a world of voxels and fantasy,
    I set out on an epic journey,
    Exploring planets, near and far,
    Crafting, fighting, shooting stars


    With quests and skills, and battles grand,
    I rise from humble to command,
    Defending realms from evil's grasp,
    And forging my own hero's path

    In this game, the thrill never ends,
    With endless worlds to comprehend,
    I am drawn in, entranced, enthralled,
    By the magic of this voxel world.

### Player Review

As a player of this game, I am absolutely amazed at its potential. The fact that everything is generated procedurally using data-oriented design adds an incredible level of depth and replayability to the game. No two playthroughs are the same, as the game's environments, characters, and quests are all generated on the fly, offering a unique experience for each player.

I also love the voxel-based graphics, which give the game a charming, retro aesthetic. The character customization options are also fantastic, allowing me to create my own unique avatar and equip them with procedurally generated weapons and armor.

The game's open-world environment is vast and immersive, and I love the feeling of exploring and discovering new things as I play. The procedurally generated quests add an extra layer of challenge and excitement, as I never quite know what to expect.

Overall, I am thoroughly impressed by this game and would highly recommend it to any fans of RPGs. It offers endless replayability, charming graphics, and a unique gameplay experience that I have never seen before.

## Origin Story

Zoxel is a voxel-based RPG that has been in development for over a decade. The game was first made in Java in 2009, and has since been remade using different game engines such as Unity and Unreal. The most recent iteration of the game added Unity's Entity Component System (ECS), which improved its performance and scalability.

Now, the game is being remade again, this time using a custom game engine that the developer has written themselves. This will allow the game to be tailored to the developer's specific needs and requirements, resulting in a more unique and innovative gameplay experience for players.

Players can expect a vast, open-world environment to explore, as well as procedurally generated quests and enemies. The game's charming voxel-based graphics and character customization options will also add to the experience.

Overall, Zoxel is a game that has been developed with passion and dedication over many years, and players can look forward to a unique and engaging gameplay experience.
