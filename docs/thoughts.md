I need to do marching cubes for dirt
I need a good pipeline for models and animations - use realtime engine updates too for textures etc - if file_updates enabled
I should add text colors in terminal output
Terminal UI refresh per frame for server / headless modes - showing stats and log - take in inputs too
Generate voxels on gpu - because its cool
GPU Instancing of grass next - make a voxel have links to models and use one based on position in map and noise - maybe store a variation byte as well?
Give a new build folder - per <game_name>_<OS>_<architecture>
Make music good - import lmms files - use better piano notes for now until generation improves
Add auto tests in as parameters
Make a builder app?
Make editor app, it should reload modules of C code onto the game engine part
