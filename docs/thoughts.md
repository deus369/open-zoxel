I need to do marching cubes for dirt
I need a good pipeline for models and animations - use realtime engine updates too for textures etc - if file_updates enabled
I should add text colors in terminal output
Terminal UI refresh per frame for server / headless modes - showing stats and log - take in inputs too
Generate voxels on gpu - because its cool
GPU Instancing of grass next - make a voxel have links to models and use one based on position in map and noise - maybe store a variation byte as well?
Give a new build folder - per <game_name>_<OS>_<architecture>
Make music good - import lmms files - use better piano notes for now until generation improves
Add auto tests in as parameters
Make a builder app?
Make editor app, it should reload modules of C code onto the game engine part
Make a damn start screen... what kind idk
Make a logo splash - penguin
Can we build parts of project at once instead of entire thing? .o files?

- networking -
run zoxel service on linode
clients will connect automatically
show an icon on main menu if connected
make a terminal in game that i can input messages to
send ping packets to server
server to show in realtime how many players connected
