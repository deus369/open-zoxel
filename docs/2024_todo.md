fixes:

- [ ] sometimes jump isnt working
- [ ] cannot rotate down and up
- [ ] alt + enter should reduce window size - because it doesn't  fit screen bounds
- [ ] make rotate with mouse perfect
    - [ ] make rotate physics body towards camera rotation
    - [ ] make camera rotation free flow, but position should be fixed onto body

User Experiencece:

- [ ] fade in when loading game world
- [ ] add a new game / load game flow
- [ ] show what controller we are using
- [ ] make a editor / loader for fonts
    - [ ] load a boring  font for the normies


todo:

- [ ] save/load settings for window size / window maximized state
- [ ] save/load debug settings like disable_mouse_lock
- [ ] buy new keyboard


improve visuals:

- [ ] add AO on models
- [ ] add outline to models


cool mechanics:

- [ ] portals, bring them back

# from inputs

# todo: refactor keyboard and mouse to use zevices
# todo: reset zevice_stick and zevice_pointer in systems
# todo: extract keyboard & mouse in systems
# todo: sdl device disconnects, handle as spawning new entities, add to player if player mode is accepting new device (if they disconnect, put their control state in accepting)
# todo: get change filters to work in multithreaded systems
# todo: spawn/destroy device entity upon connection/removal
# todo: refactor deadzonoes into each individual zevice
# todo: hotkey system to do with bindings
# todo: hotkey ui

# from transforms

# todo: remove euler use, and find a way to limit quaternion rotations used for camera atm
#      ai mentioned something about using axis and angle of a quaternion
