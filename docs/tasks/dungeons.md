# dungeons

- world dungeons and instanced ones (seperate world)
- now we just need to spawn our world dungeon

- [ ] simulate dungeon by steps, spawn a dungeon core, it will build dungeon block by block
- [ ] add dungeon tentacles, that come out of the dungeon core
    - [ ] these will be voxel based but with skeleton animation
    - [ ] it will be transparent so looks like ghost tentacles
    - [ ] they will hold blocks and move things around

- [ ] create a new block called dungeon core - give it a custom texture for visual ease
- [ ] test function that adds that item to player - just add in during player character spawning
- [ ] dungeon core can spawn enemies
- [ ] dungeon core remembers where its tendrils extend to
